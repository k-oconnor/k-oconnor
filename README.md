- 👋 Hi, I’m @k-oconnor. 
- 👀 I’m interested in economics, data science, and generally, using math to model the real world.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for my economics MA at UT Austin, with coursework in python for big data, statistical learning, solidity/rust, auction theory, and game theory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any rudimentary projects that help build general competencies.
- 📫 You can reach me at k.oconnor@utexas.edu
